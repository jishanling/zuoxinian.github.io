We need a system of new statistics, e.g., [A New View of Statistics](https://www.sportsci.org/resource/stats/index.html).

We need a consortium on reproducibility, e.g., [CURE Consortium](http://cure.web.unc.edu/).

We need a guide line for reproducibility, e.g., [The Evaluation of Reliability, Repeatability, and Reproducibility](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10543406.2016.1265547).

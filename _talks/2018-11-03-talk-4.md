Developmental cognitive neuroscience is meeting an important opportunity of her development. In-vivo neuroimaging technology provides safe and efficient approaches for investigations of brain and mind changes across different stages of the human lifespan. With advances on sharing big data and open sciences, this field approaches scientific base for ultimately answering ‘What is the mechanism on brain and mind development across the human lifespan, and how nature and nurture executive their influences on the lifespan development?’. This gives birth of a new field, namely Developmental Population Neuroscience (DPN), which will be introduced by the present keynote. The speaker will survey and foresee DPN progresses by presenting the most established and recognized scientific findings during the past two decades as well as connecting it with the national brain project.
